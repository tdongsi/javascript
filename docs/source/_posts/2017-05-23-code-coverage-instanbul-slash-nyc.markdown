Code coverage for NodeJS projects.

<!--more-->

### Settings in `.nycrc` file

What is the standard code coverage settings look like?

``` json Example nycrc file
{
  "reporter": [
    "text-summary",
    "html",
    "lcov"
  ],
  "lines": 46,
  "statements": 47,
  "functions": 44,
  "branches": 35,
  "exclude": [
    "**/node_modules/**",
    "**/grunt/**",
    "**/public/**",
    "**/test/**",
    "i18n-express.js",
    "newrelic.js",
    "app.js",
    "Gruntfile.js",
    "scripts/**",
    "build/**"
  ],
  "extension": [
    ".js",
    ".jsx"
  ],
  "require": [
    "babel/register"
  ],
  "all": true,
  "check-coverage": true,
  "cache": true,
  "report-dir": "./build/coverage"
}
```

### `nyc` settings

Is it possible to specify the custom location of `.nycrc` file? Short answer: NO. Long answer: Depending on the custom location in question.

nycrc support is implemented in [this PR](https://github.com/istanbuljs/nyc/pull/391/files).
The relevant code for processing `.nycrc` file is in [this file](https://github.com/istanbuljs/nyc/blob/master/lib/config-util.js):

``` javascript .nycrc processing, extracted on May 20th 2017
const findUp = require('find-up')
...

// load config from a cascade of sources:
// * command line arguments
// * package.json
// * .nycrc
Config.loadConfig = function (argv, cwd) {
  cwd = cwd || process.env.NYC_CWD || process.cwd()
  var pkgPath = findUp.sync('package.json', {cwd: cwd})
  var rcPath = findUp.sync('.nycrc', {cwd: cwd})
  var rcConfig = null

  if (rcPath) {
    rcConfig = JSON.parse(
      fs.readFileSync(rcPath, 'utf-8')
    )
  }

...
```

The [`find-up`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/find-up) returns valid path if the file `.nycrc` is in the parent folders.
In Jenkins environment, it means that if you can place that file into a parent folder of the workspace, then `.nycrc` can be found.

The commandline arguments and their default values can be retrieved from `nyc help`, as shown belows:

``` plain Installing nyc
mymac:learn_grunt tdongsi$ npm i nyc -g
/Users/tdongsi/.nvm/versions/node/v4.6.1/bin/nyc -> /Users/tdongsi/.nvm/versions/node/v4.6.1/lib/node_modules/nyc/bin/nyc.js
nyc@10.3.2 /Users/tdongsi/.nvm/versions/node/v4.6.1/lib/node_modules/nyc

mymac:learn_grunt tdongsi$ which nyc
/Users/tdongsi/.nvm/versions/node/v4.6.1/bin/nyc

mymac:learn_grunt tdongsi$ nyc help config
nyc [command] [options]

run your tests with the nyc bin to instrument them with coverage
```

#### Related problem

The problem with code coverage thresholds in `.nycrc` is explained in [this question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44148412/increase-code-coverage-gate-for-protected-master-branch-in-github-enterprise). 
In summary, if a person wants to increase code coverage threshold in `.nycrc` file sitting in a Github repository with protected branches, the PR cannot be merged because the test run fails.
The easy way to work around this is to disable "Include adminstrators" under "Require status checks to pass before merging" in Repository settings -> Branches -> master, then add the manager into the Admin group. 
However, in this approach, sneaky developers can still reduce the code coverage threshold in their branches and merge their PRs.
For larger teams, the file `.nycrc` should be separated from the repository in question. 
Instead, that file should be included into the Docker image for running that job (assumption: containerized Jenkins system with Kubernetes plugin) and symlinked to workspace folder or its parent directory accordingly. 
See above and `find-up` package for explanations.
